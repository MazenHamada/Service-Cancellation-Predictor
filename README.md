# Service-Cancellation-Predictor
# Project objective:
Service cancellation is simply when customers leave doing business with an entity. It involves determining the possibility of customers stopping doing business with an entity. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because the cost of acquiring a new customer is five times more than that of retaining an existing customer, so for many businesses, the ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of canceling service, while there is still time to do something about it. The main aim of this project is to predict if the customer is at a high risk of canceling service.
